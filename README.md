## Getting Started

This section will guide you through setting up the project on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- Node.js (version >= 16)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

1.  Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/and734/PhoWebnotes.git
    ```

2.  Navigate to the project directory:

    ```bash
    cd PhoWebnotes
    ```

3.  Install the dependencies:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

    or

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

## Usage

Explain how to use your application. Include examples and use cases.

### Running the App

To start the application, run:

```bash
npm start
```

or

```bash
yarn start
```

This will start the app in development mode and open it in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start` or `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.
You may also see any linting errors in the console.

#### `npm test` or `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build` or `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

#### `npm run eject` or `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
